❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Using Tableau

📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. This project analyzes heart disease data using Tableau to identify major risk factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, and physical activity.

The objective is to transform raw healthcare data into meaningful visual insights that help healthcare professionals, policymakers, and individuals make informed decisions.

🎯 Problem Statement
Analyzing large-scale health data manually is complex. There is a need to:

Identify high-risk groups
Understand lifestyle impact on heart disease
Compare demographic health trends
Support preventive healthcare decisions
This project uses interactive dashboards to uncover patterns and correlations in heart disease data.
